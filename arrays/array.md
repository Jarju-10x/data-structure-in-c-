# Array Patterns and Techniques

Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming. Here are some common patterns and techniques used with arrays:

## 1. Two Pointers Technique

- **Description:** Using two pointers to efficiently solve problems by iterating through the array from different ends or speeds.
- **Use Cases:** Solving problems involving searching, manipulation, or comparison within an array.

## 2. Sliding Window Technique

- **Description:** Utilizing a window that slides through the array to find subarrays or subsequences that meet certain conditions.
- **Use Cases:** Problems requiring finding a subset of contiguous elements (subarray) that fulfills specific criteria.

## 3. Prefix Sum Technique

- **Description:** Precomputing cumulative sums to optimize certain array-based problems, especially those involving range queries.
- **Use Cases:** Calculating subarray sums, range queries, or counting elements within a range.

## 4. Binary Search on Sorted Arrays

- **Description:** Applying binary search to efficiently search for elements in a sorted array.
- **Use Cases:** Searching for a specific element or finding a boundary within a sorted array.

## 5. Kadane's Algorithm

- **Description:** An algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in an array, particularly useful for handling contiguous elements.
- **Use Cases:** Problems involving identifying the maximum sum subarray.

## 6. Frequency Counting

- **Description:** Counting the frequency of elements in an array, often using hash maps or arrays for efficient storage.
- **Use Cases:** Identifying the most frequent or least frequent elements in an array.

## 7. Sorting Algorithms

- **Description:** Using various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort) to arrange elements in a specific order.
- **Use Cases:** Rearranging elements to enable easier searching or to meet specific requirements.

## 8. Dynamic Programming with Arrays

- **Description:** Applying dynamic programming concepts to solve problems by creating and utilizing arrays to store intermediate results.
- **Use Cases:** Problems requiring optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
